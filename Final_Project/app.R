The current liabilities are how much the company needs to pay to other subjects in the future, such as taxes payable and wages.It is hard to say how good or bad a current ratio is, as the standard varies a lot across industries. To avoid this, we only select out the data of companies within the same industry (Polish companies in the manufacturing sector, which will be discussed with details later in Chapter Source Data.) But even in the same industry, getting a current ratio above the industry average line is not the same as the signal of well management, because it is possible that the company resources are not efficiently used. Similarly, getting a current ratio below one is typically an alarm that now the company is not able to pay all its obligations if they are all due at one, but the company may be struggling in one financial reporting period and then becomes healthy in the future. In a short summary, the current ratio itself is limited in comparison between different companies without other liquidity ratios' help, and we should always look at the trending information rather than focusing on analyzing data from a single financial period.

The dataset contains five subsets, each has 64 indicators predicting corporate bankruptcy from the first year of forecasting period to the fifth year of it. The companies classified as 0 in the dataset remained healthy financial status after the forecasting period, while those classified as 1 did not survive successfully. The explanation of 64 indicators is appended in the Appendix chapter. In the project, I extract out the column of X4/Attr 4 as the subject of the study. 

Two things about the quality of the data set need to be mentioned. First, the data is heavily imbalanced. There are much more healthy companies existing than the problematic ones, as you can see in the above table. Second, the data is not comprehensive about all the companies operating in the forecasting period, because some information is not public or missing from the original database.")
