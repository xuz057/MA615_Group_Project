## Document assignment

Consider the following situation:  

A sloppy printer produces books with an average of 2 misprints per page. You want to
know how many pages in a 50 page book will have more than k misprints. Make an n x k table that shows the probability that n or fewer pages in a 50 page book will have more than k misprints.  



Explanation:

This problem contains two parts to solve. To find out the probability that n pages in the book will have more than k misprints, we need to figure out two things:

(a) The probability that n pages in the book of 50 pages are selected, or are seen as 'successful trials' in a binomial distribution. For exmaple, if n = 10, the prob(a) wil be


$\binom{50}{10} p^{10}q^{40}$


P and q are solved as following.


(b) The probability that one page has more than k misprints. This should be solved by using Poisson Distribution because k misprints occur with a known constant rate 2 per page and it is reasonable to suppose that the number of misprints on each page is independent of one another. Then, we set x = the number of misprints shown on one page and we get:


$P_0(x=k) = e^{-2}\frac{2^k}{k!}$


So $P_1(x>k) = 1-P(x \leq$ k)= 1-$\sum_{i=0}^k e^{-2}\frac{2^k}{k!}$


This is the prob that a page will have more than k misprints.


So our final answer is $\binom{50}{n} p^{n}q^{50-n}$ with p = 1-$\sum_{i=0}^k e^{-2}\frac{2^k}{k!}$

for ( i in 1:50) { 
  for (j in 1:10){
    p0 <- ppois(j,lambda = 2,lower.tail = FALSE)
    table[i,j] = pbinom(i, size=50, prob=p0) 
  }}
