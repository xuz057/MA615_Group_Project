## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
data_new<-SARStats %>%
  group_by(Countym) %>%
  summarise(n=sum(Count))%>%
  filter(Countym!='[Total]')%>%
  arrange(desc(n))
ggplot(data_new, aes(x = Countym,y =n, group = factor(1))) + 
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.5)+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5))

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
