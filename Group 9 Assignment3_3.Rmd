# Readme

**We decided to explore data on financial crimes in California, USA, for the year 2018. We narrowed down on credit card frauds that were filed with the enforcement network. The instrument involved in the frauds is U.S. currency. Our data has the different suspicious activities related to frauds in Depository Institution, Money Services Business, Casino/Card Club and Securities/Futures industries across different counties in the state of California. The data is taken from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network website.** 

We are using the data from:
```{r}
  head(read.csv("SARStats.csv") )
```
  

This is how we generated the dataset:

**Xuan's plot**

As we get a lot of regions here, it is hard to put all the information on the same plot. So I randomly picked 4 counties: ("Los Angeles County, CA","Santa Clara County, CA","Orange County, CA","Santa Barbara County, CA"). 

I don't want the text to be overlapped with each other, so I switch the direction of x-axis and y-axis. Now the x-axis becomes vertical and the y-axis becomes horizontal.
  
Position = "dodge" places overlapping objects directly beside one another. This makes it easier to compare individual values.
  
```{r}
SARStats <- read_csv("SARStats.csv") 
SARStats$Count <- as.numeric(SARStats$Count)
xuan <-SARStats %>%
  group_by(Industry,Countym)%>%
  summarise(n=sum(Count))%>%
  filter(Industry != '[Total]' & Countym %in% c("Los Angeles County, CA","Santa Clara County, CA","Orange County, CA","Santa Barbara County, CA")) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
ggplot(data=xuan,mapping=aes(x=Countym,y=n),group=factor(1),xlab(Countym))+ 
          geom_bar(position = "dodge",aes(fill=Industry),stat = "Identity")+
          theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5))+
          coord_flip()
```

**Jianhao's plot**

```{r}
data_new<-SARStats %>%
  group_by(Countym,Industry) %>%
  summarise(n=sum(Count))%>%
  filter(Countym!='[Total]')%>%
  filter(Industry!='[Total]')%>%
  arrange(desc(n))
ggplot(data_new, aes(x = Countym,y =n, group = factor(1))) + 
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.5,aes(fill=Industry))+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5))+ggtitle("Jianhao Yan")
```

**Discussion & Conclusion**

From this graph, we can find that the Los Angeles County, CA has the most financial frauds, and these frauds mostly happened in depositary industry.


**Guangyan's Plot**

I want to figure out the relationship between Industry and Suspicious Activity, and find what is the most happening suspicious acitivity in every Industry so that we could intentionaly decrease the suspiciosu activities.
```{r}
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
data<-read.csv("SARStats.csv")
#summary(data)
data$Count <- as.numeric(data$Count)
data <- filter(data, !(str_detect(string = data$Industry,pattern = "\\[Total\\]")))
data <- filter(data, !(str_detect(string = data$Suspicious.Activity,pattern = "\\[Total\\]")))
data <- filter(data, !(str_detect(string = data$Count,pattern = "\\[Total\\]")))
data1<-data %>%
  group_by(Industry,Suspicious.Activity) %>%
  summarise(sum=sum(Count)) %>%
  group_by(Industry) %>%
  arrange(desc(sum))
kable(data1)

ggplot(data1,aes(x=Industry,y = sum,fill = Suspicious.Activity)) + geom_bar(stat="identity",position = "dodge")+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) + ggtitle("Guangyan Yu")


```

**Discussion and Conclusion **

Through this plot, we can know that, firstly, the two industries----Casino/Card Club - Tribal Authorized Casino and Securities/Futures, have low suspicious activity, while Depository Institution and Money Services Business (MSB) have relatively high number of suspicious activity. Secondly, in the two high suspicious activity industry, Depository Institution has more kinds of suspicious activity than MSB. Thirdly, it is obvious that suspicious activity in Credit/Debit Card sets the most proportion in Depository Institution, and for MSB, suspicious activity in Other Fraud sets the most proportion.


**Megha's Plot**

Following the discussion and conclusions drawn by Xuan, Jianho and Guangyan, the maximum number of credit card frauds were in the Depository Institution and Money Services Business (MSB) industries. Taking these two industries, I plotted the frauds filed vs the two industries for 2016, 2017 and 2018. (I took data for 2016, 2017 and 2018 from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network website)
```{r, fig.align='center'}
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

d <- read.csv("SARStats (2).csv")
data <- as.data.frame(d)
data$Count <- as.numeric(data$Count)

#Removing the year, state, product and instrument columns since they are constant
data <- data[, -c(2,6,7)]

#Changing column names for easier interpretation
colnames(data) <- c("year","county","industry","activity","frauds")

#Filtering out the rows that contain [Total], i.e., subtotals
data <- filter(data, data$activity != "[Total]")
data <- filter(data, data$industry != "[Total]")

#Retaining only the frauds in the Depository Institution and MSB industries
data_dnew <- filter(data, data$industry == "Depository Institution")
data_mnew <- filter(data, data$industry == "Money Services Business (MSB)")

#Row-binding the data
data_f <- rbind(data_dnew, data_mnew)
rownames(data_f) <- 1:nrow(data_f)

#Grouping months into a year
library(stringr)

data_yr <-  data_f %>%
  select( year, county, industry, activity , frauds) %>%
  mutate(yr =  substr(x = data_f$year , start = 1, stop = 4 ) ) %>%
  group_by( yr, county, industry, activity ) %>%
  summarize(frauds = sum(frauds))

#Plotting the frauds filed vs industries.
ggplot(data_yr, aes(x = industry, y = frauds))+
  xlab("Industry")+
  ylab("Frauds Filed")+
  geom_bar(aes(fill = yr), stat = "identity", position = "dodge")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=0,hjust=1,vjust=0.5))+
  theme(legend.text = element_text(size = 9),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 9, face = "bold"),legend.position = "right")+
  ggtitle("Megha's Plot")
```

**Conclusion**

Depository Institution and MSB industries recorded the highest number of frauds that were filed in 2018. Yet, from 2016-18, the plot above shows a decreasing trend in the credit card frauds in California, being filed with the enforcement network, for both the Depository Institution and MSB industries. Fewer frauds have been being filed with the enforcement network in 2018 than in 2017 and 2016. The filing of frauds corresponding to the Depository Institution has seen a decrease of around 27% and the one corresponding to the MSB industry, a decrease of approximately 17% from 2017 to 2018.
